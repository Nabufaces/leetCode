Given two integer arrays A and B, return the maximum length of an subarray that appears in both arrays.

#### Example:
```
Input:
A: [1,2,3,2,1]
B: [3,2,1,4,7]
Output: 3

Explanation: 
The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
```

Note:
1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100
