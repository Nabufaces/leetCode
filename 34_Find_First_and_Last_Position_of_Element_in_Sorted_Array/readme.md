Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of `O(log n)`.

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```
